# Overview



This page is devoted to document and make easier the use of LIGA- Library for 
Geometric Algebra. Our intent is provide a good experience of use for students 
and reseachers interesting in use (and programming) a Geometric Algebra 
framework. All scripts were made in [Julia language](https://julialang.org), 
version 0.6. 

There is a miscellany of libraries for GA study. Our intent here is not to provide software to compete with such libraries in performance or generality. Our goal is to provide a relatively simple, open, easy to install and focused environment for Julia users. This library was built 
just reading basic operations in books, that is, no worries about analyzing the best way to program all functions based on other libraries.

It's important a previous contact with Geometric Algebra in theoretical aspects.
In this sense, we recommend the following references:

[1] Christian Perwass, *Geometric Algebra with Applications in Engineering*, 
Springer Series in Geometry and Computing, 2009.

[2] Valter Soares Camargo, *Conformal Geometric Algebra and Distance Geometry*, (Doctoral Thesis).
IMECC-UNICAMP, 2015. 

We really like the book given by [1], so we tried to provide an experience focused on that notation.

## Current Status

The current status of this project is beta quality, don't use for anything important. We can provide some multi-dimensional spaces but without visualization of elements (it is a goal feature for future).

## Developed by

This project was developed as part of master degree dissertation of Vinicius Riter. The main contributors of this work are

* Vinicius Riter
* Emerson Vitor Castelani
* Jair da Silva
* Wesley Shirabayashi
* Valter Soares Camargo
