# LIGA - Library for Geometric Algebra

It is dev version of Liga. 

### Basic usage

Once the files have been downloaded, you need to import `NewLiga`. In order to do that, type:

``` 
push!(LOAD_PATH,"path to file/NewLiga/")
using NewLiga
```
After that, Liga was imported. To use, just need to type:

```
layout(3,1,"Conformal")
```

Consequently, the Conformal enviroment G(3,1) is created. If you need to setup other enviroment, you need to restart Julia and import Liga again.
